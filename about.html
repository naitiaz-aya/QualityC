            <p>Rental companies usually offer drivers additional coverage options for a price. If you buy their
                coverage, they say you can minimize your liability while driving their rental car. However, you may be
                covered already through your own auto or homeowner's policies. Read your insurance policies for
                specifics, and call your insurers if you're uncertain about the coverage. If you're traveling on
                business, you may be covered under your employerâ€™s insurance. Some credit card companies and motor clubs
                provide members with free rental protection when you use their cards to pay for rentals.</p>
